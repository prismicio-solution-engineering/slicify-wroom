# WORK IN PROGRESS - Prismic Try Out Project

Brought to you by Prismic Solution Engineering Team

Prismic Solution Engineering team has built this starter to try out the tools and experience working with a Prismic website.

The starter project has a homepage in all locales and a landing page in both en-us and fr-fr locales.
- Editors can start right away creating and editing documents
- Developers can edit or add new data models (slices and custom types). We are using Tailwind UI in the project so youâ€™ll be able to quickly test the Slice Machine workflow and ship a new slices to the content editors.


_Prerequisite: have node v18 or above installed on your local machine : https://nodejs.org/en/_

## Step 1 - Go in your PoC project folder and install packages

```bash
cd slicify
```
```bash
npm i
```

## Step 2 - Start your local website

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now access your website here : [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) .

## Step 3 - Start your local SliceMachine

```bash
npm run slicemachine
```

You can now access your SliceMachine here : [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999) .

This is where you will create and edit any data structure for your project.


Start building your slices !
